This addon introduces a mechanic for opening doors with weapons. Instead of breaking down, the doors open! After being breached, the door cannot be used for a set period of time.

# Features:

- Shooting the door handle increases the damage multiplier, allowing you to breach the door faster.
- Hand damage is not counted!

_It doesn't work with explosions_

# Configuration: 

The addon can be customized by adding the following ConVars to your server's **garrysmod\cfg\server.cfg** file:

Enable or disable door breaching mechanics:

```doorbreach_enabled 1```

Initial door health: 

```doorbreach_health 100```

Damage multiplier when hitting the door handle: 

```doorbreach_handlemultiplier 2```

Door recovery time after being breached: 

```doorbreach_respawntime 30```

The speed of opening the door after breach: 

```doorbreach_speed 500```
    
**The default value of the door opening speed in L4D is 200. I suggest that it is the same in Gmod. [Source of information](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Prop_door_rotating#Inputs).**
